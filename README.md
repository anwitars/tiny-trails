[![API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/API%20Docs-online-brightgreen)](https://api.trls.link/docs)

**A transparent URL shortener API with no accounts, no tracking, and no paywalls.** Public API available at [api.trls.link](https://api.trls.link/docs).

## üöÄ Quick Start

Shorten a URL:

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.trls.link/pave -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://google.com"}'
```

You will receive a JSON response containing a `trail_id`.
Open it in your browser: `https://api.trls.link/t/{trail_id}`
You will be redirected to the original URL ‚Äî and a [visit](#visit) will be counted.

## ‚ú® Features

It shortens URLs. That's it ‚Äî but with a twist:
- **No accounts, no tiers** ‚Äî everything is available for free, no sign-up required.
- **Peek before you click (if you wish to)** ‚Äî see the destination URL without being redirected first.
- **Privacy first** ‚Äî no IP storage, only hashed values for visit counting.
- **Simple, predictable API** ‚Äî easy to integrate everywhere.

## üêç Why Python?

- Fast to develop and iterate on.
- I know it best ‚Äî fewer bugs, faster features.
- If Trails grows, I might rewrite it in a more performant language.

## üìñ Terminology

### Trail

A shortened URL. Each Trail has its own [Token](#token).

#### Trail Lifetime

Set by the user or defaulting to 3 days. After expiry, the [Trail](#trail) will be inaccessible, even with its [Token](#token).

#### Token

Unique secret key for managing a [Trail](#trail). Sent via `X-Trail-Token` header.

### Visit

A redirect through a [Trail's](#trail) [traverse](#traverse-endpoint-get) endpoint. Counts as **unique** if the hashed IP has not visited before.

### Peek

View the original URL without redirecting. Does not count as a [Visit](#visit).

### Hashed IP

SHA-256 hash of the visitor‚Äôs IP, stored only for uniqueness checks.

## üì° Endpoints

### /t/{trail_id} GET <a name="traverse-endpoint-get"></a>

## üõ† Installation

### Requirements

- **Python 3.12+** (Likely works on 3.11+)
- **PostgreSQL 15+**
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for project and dependency management
- Docker (optional, for self-hosting)

### Local Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anwitars/tiny-trails
cd tiny-trails
poetry install
tiny-trails serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \
  --db postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/tiny_trails
```

Install runtime only dependencies:
```sh
poetry install --without=dev,test
```

CLI help:
